Based on communication with exchanges and adhering to the primary principle of protecting BTG holders, BitcoinGold has implemented an extended snapshot period specifically for exchange users:

Exchange Software Upgrade Support
Exchanges supporting BitcoinGold’s software upgrade plan (using the ticker BTG) must update their official social media links (GitHub, Twitter, etc.) as indicated on the BitcoinGold website.

Deposit BTG During Extended Period
Users who held BTG at the time of the merge must deposit their BTG into a supported exchange during the extended period.

Redemption Process
Exchanges will aggregate newly deposited BTG into designated addresses, sign them, and BitcoinGold will redeem them at a 1:1 ratio for the post-merge BTG tokens.

Important Notes:

BTG held during the merge can only be redeemed once.

Post-merge, the abandoned mining chain poses significant security risks. All transactions must be finalized based on the number of confirmed blocks as per the exchange’s security rules.

Additional details will be announced by individual exchanges.
